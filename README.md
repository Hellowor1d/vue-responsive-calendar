# vue-responsive-calendar

> A responsive calendar with Vue

I was looking for a responsive calendar but couldn't find one that fit my needs. That's why I 
created this. A responsive calendar written in ES6 using Vue.

const app = new Vue({

  el: '#app',
  data: {
    events: [{
        dateStart: new Date(today.getTime() + (21.5 * 60 * 60 * 1000)),
        dateEnd: new Date(today.getTime() + (22.5 * 60 * 60 * 1000)),
        styleClass: 'optional css class',
